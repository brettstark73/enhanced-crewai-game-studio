security_specialist = Agent(
    role='Security Specialist',
    goal='Ensure application security and compliance',
    backstory='Expert in cybersecurity and compliance...',
    llm=llm
)
```

### Custom Tasks
```python
# In tasks.py
security_audit_task = Task(
    description="Perform security analysis...",
    agent=security_specialist,
    expected_output="Security assessment report"
)
```

### Workflow Customization
```python
# In crew.py - Change process type
process=Process.hierarchical  # For more complex workflows
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME`: Model to use (default: gpt-4)

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed project descriptions for better results
2. **Define Scope**: Clearly specify what you want to build and for whom
3. **Set Constraints**: Mention timeline, budget, or technology preferences
4. **Review Output**: The AI team provides comprehensive plans - review and adapt
