# Development Plan: Pixel Snake Game

**Target Audience:** casual gamers who enjoy retro/nostalgic games, web users looking for quick entertainment during breaks, mobile users who want simple but engaging games
**Timeline:** 3 weeks

## Complete Development Plan

**Deployment Strategy**

1. **Environment Setup**: We will have three environments - Development, Staging, and Production. The Development environment is for developers to test their code. The Staging environment is an exact replica of the Production environment used for testing before release. The Production environment is where the live application runs.

2. **Hosting Platform**: We will use AWS as our hosting platform. AWS provides a range of services that can support our application's needs, including EC2 for server hosting, S3 for static file storage, and RDS for database hosting.

3. **Containerization**: We will use Docker to create a container for our application. This ensures that the application runs the same way in all environments. Docker Compose will be used to manage multi-container applications.

4. **Database Deployment and Migrations**: MongoDB will be hosted on AWS RDS. We will use a tool like Mongoose for database migrations.

5. **Scaling Strategy**: We will use AWS Auto Scaling to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on the load. This ensures that our application can handle a large number of concurrent users.

**CI/CD Pipeline**

1. **Version Control**: We will use Git and GitHub for version control. Developers will create feature branches for each task and merge them into the main branch upon completion.

2. **Continuous Integration**: We will use Jenkins for continuous integration. Jenkins will monitor the main branch and automatically build the application and run tests whenever new commits are pushed.

3. **Continuous Deployment**: We will use Jenkins for continuous deployment as well. If the build and tests pass, Jenkins will automatically deploy the application to the Staging environment. After further testing and approval, the application will be manually deployed to the Production environment.

4. **Configuration Management**: We will use Ansible for configuration management. Ansible will ensure that all our servers are configured correctly and consistently.

**Infrastructure Setup**

1. **Server Setup**: We will use AWS EC2 instances to host our application. The application will be containerized using Docker.

2. **Database Setup**: We will use AWS RDS to host our MongoDB database. 

3. **Static File Storage**: We will use AWS S3 to store static files like game assets.

4. **Load Balancer**: We will use AWS Elastic Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.

5. **CDN**: We will use AWS CloudFront as our CDN to serve game assets faster.

**Monitoring and Logging**

1. **Application Monitoring**: We will use AWS CloudWatch to monitor our application's performance and resource usage.

2. **Log Management**: We will use AWS CloudTrail for log management. This will help us track user activity and debug issues.

3. **Error Tracking**: We will use Sentry for error tracking. This will help us identify and fix issues faster.

**Backup and Disaster Recovery**

1. **Data Backup**: We will use AWS Backup to regularly backup our database and server data.

2. **Disaster Recovery**: We will use AWS Disaster Recovery to quickly recover our application in case of a disaster. This includes restoring from backups and switching to a standby environment if necessary.

**Security and Access Controls**

1. **Data Transmission**: We will use HTTPS for secure data transmission.

2. **User Authentication**: We will use JWT for user authentication.

3. **Access Control**: We will use AWS IAM to manage access to our AWS resources.

4. **Data Encryption**: We will use AWS KMS for data encryption.

**Cost and Resource Estimation**

1. **Server Costs**: We will use AWS EC2 instances, which are charged per hour. The cost will depend on the instance type and the number of instances.

2. **Database Costs**: We will use AWS RDS, which is also charged per hour. The cost will depend on the instance type and the storage size.

3. **Storage Costs**: We will use AWS S3 for storage, which is charged based on the amount of data stored.

4. **Data Transfer Costs**: We will be charged for data transfer in and out of AWS.

5. **Other Costs**: There may be additional costs for other AWS services like CloudFront, CloudWatch, and Backup.

By following this deployment strategy, CI/CD pipeline, and infrastructure setup, we can ensure that the Snake Game is deployable, scalable, and maintainable in production.
